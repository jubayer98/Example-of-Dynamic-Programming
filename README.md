# Example-of-Dynamic-Programming

This assignment tests your understanding about dynamic programming. A palindrome is a string that reads the same from
front and back. The trivial case is that, a string consisting of only one letter is a palindrome by definition. Any string can be
viewed as a sequence of palindromes. 

For example,

the string “bobseesanna” can e.g be viewed as being made up of palindromes in the following ways:

“bobseesanna” = “bob” + “sees” + “anna”

“bobseesanna” = “bob” + “s” + “ee” + “s” + “anna”

“bobseesanna” = “b” + “o” + “b” + “sees” + “a” + “n” + “n” + “a”

Given an input string s, your task in this assignment is to decompose s into the minimum number of palindromes.
For example, the minimum number of palindromes required to construct the string “bobseesanna” is 3 and the
palindromes are “bob”, “sees” and “anna”.
